# Backend Homework Assignment

## Goal
You are tasked with optimizing two endpoints for an online game 

## Background
To find the best opponent for a user, you need to find someone who:

- they have never played
- has similar interests as the user

Unfortunately, the programmer who built the `get_next_opponent` method didn't know much about SQL, memory allocation, or organizing their code. Your task as a senior engineer is to help improve this codebase.

## Assignment
Your task is to accomplish the following:
- Show how you would improve the `get_next_opponent` method.
- Organize the codebase according to your standards.

## Don't Let the Dog Eat Your Homework
Our goal is to understand your thought process, documentation style, and to get a sense of how you reason about a complex problem. Please don't spend more than 3-4 hours on this. We'd prefer incomplete work with notes on what you focused on, where you left off, and the limitations of your solution.

If you get stuck or need more information, don't hesitate to reach out for clarity!
